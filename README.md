## Features

- Easy integration with Stripe Identity Verification
- Support for both Android and iOS platforms
- Customizable brand logo display
- Simple error handling and result parsing
- Type-safe verification results

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stripe_identity_plugin: ^1.0.1
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```dart
final stripeIdentity = StripeIdentityPlugin();

// Start verification
final (status, message) = await stripeIdentity.startVerification(
  id: 'verification_session_id_from_your_server',
  key: 'ephemeral_key_secret_from_your_server',
  brandLogoUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/logo.png', // Optional
);

// Handle the result
switch (status) {
  case VerificationResult.completed:
    print('Verification completed successfully');
  case VerificationResult.canceled:
    print('User canceled verification');
  case VerificationResult.failed:
    print('Verification failed: $message');
  case VerificationResult.unknown:
    print('Unknown error occurred: $message');
}
```

### Important Notes

1. Call your server endpoint to obtain the `verificationSessionId` and `ephemeralKeySecret` before starting the verification process.
2. When providing a brand logo, ensure it's a square image with recommended dimensions of 32x32 points.
3. The verification flow is handled entirely by Stripe's native SDK, ensuring a secure verification process.

## Verification Results

The plugin returns a tuple containing:

- `VerificationResult`: An enum indicating the status of verification
- `String?`: Optional message providing additional details

Possible verification results:

- `completed`: User has completed document upload and verification process
- `canceled`: User canceled the verification or didn't complete the process
- `failed`: Verification failed (includes error message)
- `unknown`: Unexpected error occurred

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0 or higher
- Android API level 21 or higher
- Flutter 3.0.0 or higher
